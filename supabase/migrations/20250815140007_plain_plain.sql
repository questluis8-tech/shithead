  # Fix RLS policies for game rooms

  1. Security Updates
    - Update existing policies to work with anonymous users
    - Allow anonymous users to create and update rooms
    - Allow hosts to update their own rooms
    - Ensure proper permissions for multiplayer functionality

  2. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new policies that allow anonymous users to interact with rooms
    - Maintain security while enabling functionality
